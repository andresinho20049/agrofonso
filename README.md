## About project

### Onion Garden: Sowing the Seeds of Success

Welcome to Onion Garden, where passion and dedication come together to bring you the freshest, highest-quality produce from our farm in Capivara, Bahia. Our journey began as a small group of farmers with a shared vision: to cultivate a better future for our community.

### From Seed to Plate

Our story starts with the selection of premium seeds, carefully chosen to ensure the best possible outcome. With each passing day, our team works tirelessly to nurture these seeds into the freshest, most delicious Cebola (onions), Tomate (tomatoes), and Feijão (beans) you'll ever taste.

### More Than Just a Farm

While we're proud of our core products, we don't stop there. We're always looking for ways to innovate and improve, whether it's through new crop varieties or sustainable farming practices. Our commitment to quality and customer satisfaction is unwavering, and we're excited to share our journey with you.
